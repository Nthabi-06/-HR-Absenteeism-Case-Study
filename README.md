# HR Case-Study: Absenteeism Unveiled and Strategies for Performance Enhancement
Please be advised that, in compliance with project confidentiality requirements, I am unable to disclose the code used in this project publicly. However, I am more than willing to discuss the project's methodology, outcomes, and provide general insights without revealing specific code details.

# Context
The manager of a medium-sized company has identified a decline in team performance, prompting the initiation of a data-driven investigation. The analysis has revealed that absenteeism among team members is a significant contributing factor to this performance deterioration. Further in-depth data analysis is imperative to unveil patterns, trends, and underlying causes of absenteeism, with the ultimate goal of developing data-driven strategies and interventions aimed at its prevention and mitigation.

# Dataset
- Human Resources Absenteeism dataset (Absenteeism table and Employee_info table)

# Expected Outcomes
- Analyze Absenteeism Patterns
- Uncover Absenteeism Determinants
- Develop a Data Visualization Dashboard
- Deliver Insights to Stakeholders
